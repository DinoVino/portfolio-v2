<h2>
    Creating a reproducible Operating System with NixOS
</h2>
<h3>
    Why did I start this project?
</h3>
<p>
    Since I have been using Linux for about 4 years, and heard about the elusive distro NixOS,
    I wanted to give it a shot. There are some really neat features that resonate with me.
    In the past, I had been distrohopping a lot: jumping from one linux distro to the other. 
    None of them really scratched my itch. Aside from the distrohopping, I also switch hardware a lot.
    Constantly having to setup my workspace takes a lot of time and not every setup worked out of the box
    due to differences in specs. 
    One of the other issues I ran into was that my operating system got poluted really quickly. 
    I work on so many different projects with varying programming languages and versions. 
    Maintaining this was really hard even though there were solutions because they were all
    related to the programming language. I had to manage the tools to manage the workenvironment 
    in order to work on the project. This is reaching kingdom hearts levels of convolution.
    Actually working on the projects was something I could only dream of after reliving the nightmare of managing the
    different environments.
